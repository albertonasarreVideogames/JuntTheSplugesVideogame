# 🎮 JuntTheSpluges

*A puzzle game built with Unity and C#.*

## 🕹️ Project Description

This is a personal game development project created to explore the full process of building a complete video game from scratch.

As part of my transition from backend software engineering into professional game development, this project showcases not only gameplay but also a strong technical foundation.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🧰 **Custom Level Editor**  
  Built my own map editor to simplify and speed up the level design process.

- 📈 **Well-Designed Difficulty Progression**  
  Special attention was given to balancing challenge and learning curve throughout the game.

- 🧠 **Clean Architecture & Scalable Code**  
  The codebase is organized using clean architecture principles with an emphasis on modularity and maintainability.

- 🧩 **Use of Design Patterns & Polymorphism**  
  Applied patterns like Strategy and Command to structure game logic in a flexible, extensible way.

- 🔁 **Rewind Mechanic**  
  Implemented a rewind feature that lets the player undo actions — adding both gameplay depth and technical challenge.

- 🧪 **Unit Testing**  
  Automated tests were written to ensure feature stability and allow confident iteration. Adding new features without breaking existing ones is fast and safe.

This project represents my commitment to writing solid, testable, and scalable code — even in a creative and fast-paced environment like game development.

## ▶️ How to Play

### Option 1 — Open in Unity Editor

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in **2019.4.3f1**
3. Open and run the scene: `Assets/Scenes/MainMenuAndLevels/init Menu.unity`

> ⚠️ Unity version matters. Using a different version may cause compilation issues.

### Option 2 — Playable Build

### 🧪 How to Run Tests

To run the unit and integration tests included in this project:

1. Open the project in **Unity 2019.4.3f1**.
2. From the top menu, go to:  
   **Window** → **General** → **Test Runner**
3. In the **Test Runner** window:
   - Switch to **PlayMode** .
   - Click **Run All** to execute the available tests, or just click a indidiual one.
4. Check the results in the Test Runner log.

📁 Tests are located in the `Assets/Test/` directory and include:
- ✅ Unit tests for core gameplay logic.
- 🎯 End-to-end level tests to validate win/loss conditions and progression.
- ⚙️ Utility tests for components like the Rewind System and player movement validation.

These tests ensure the game remains stable and maintainable while adding new features.

🧪 How to test and play a specific level

On the script Test/TestUtilities.cs, you can set the variable manualTestActivated to true, after that on the **Test Runner** window play any level, and you can play it manually.
The T key execute the solution step by step

### 🧪 How Edit levels
To **edit levels manually**:

1. Open the scene of any level scene, or create a new scene cloning the template on the folder Scenes/levelEditor.
2. Go to **Window > 2D > Tile Palette** to open the tile painting interface.
3. In the **Hierarchy**, select the **Grid** object. Then, choose a layer such as:
   - `Foreground` (for tiles that appear in front),
   - `Objects` (for interactive elements),
   - `Ground` (for base terrain).
4. In the Tile Palette, select the desired tile and paint directly onto the correct **Tilemap layer** in the Scene view.

> 💡 Tip: Make sure you're painting on the **correct layer**, or the elements won’t be registered properly during gameplay. Each tile corresponds to a prefab or behavior defined via ScriptableObjects in the custom map editor.

## 🛠️ How to Read the code

The main class, **GameManager**, executes the only **Update** function in the game, which handles the current game state.
The most important state is **gameState**, where we call **managePlayerMovemen**t. This function manages the players' behavior when an arrow key is pressed.

After the players move, we execute the **Strategy pattern** through **ScenarioConditionsUpdater**, which allows us to control the behavior of each scenario element individually—how they interact with each other, and whether the interaction happens in the current or the next position.

Controlling the order of these operations is very important. For example, we check if the player has won or lost only at the end of the entire process.

A very important part is the Player class, specifically the movePointChecker attribute. We use it to store the player's future position and check interactions with other scenario elements before actually updating the movement.
